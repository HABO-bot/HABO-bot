# Privacy Policy of HABO bot

### What data is saved by the bot?

When the HABO module is enabled any messages that recieve a ðŸ¤“ reaction will be saved & can later be retrieved via the leaderboard command. This is essential for the HABO leaderboard to function. You can disable this via the `/toggle habo` command.

Information about the server such as the bot settings for the server will be saved by the bot & is essential for certain features to work. This includes but is not limited to join/leave messages that where configurated by the server admins and the ID's of roles which will be automatically assigned to users under a certain event configured by a server admin.

### How do I delete my data?

You can request to have your user data deleted with the `/deletemydata` command & this will delete all leaderboard data collected by the bot within 24 hours of request.

If you want to delete any info the bot has collected on your server you can kick the bot from your server & invite it back in 2 weeks. When the bot is removed from a server it will delete any data the bot has accumulated on that server 2 weeks after leaving.

### For how long is this data stored?

All data containing message content will be deleted after 14 days to protect the users privacy and to comply with Discords privacy & saftey requirements.

Data that does not contain message content will be stored until the user requests its removal or 2 weeks after being removed from the server in which the data is related to.
